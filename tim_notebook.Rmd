### January 19th, 2024
Today was our first meeting where we decided **to use the NASA api** for our R wrapper. I will be using the Mars Rover Images API to retrieve the image URL for a certain rovers camera on a certain date.

We also worked on our proposal slide deck outlining each members work/part.

### January 25th
Worked on laying out the function parameters for my Mars Rover API.
The function will take in 3 parameters being, the rovers name, the camera angle and the date.

### January 27th 
I pushed my first version of the API function wrapper to the GitHub. This version is fully working with no known bugs.
