### January 19th, 2024
Today was our first meeting where we decided **to use the NASA api** for our R wrapper. I will be using the Asteroids - NeoWs API and the function will allow the user to search for near Earth objects based on start/end date. 

We also worked on our proposal slide deck outlining each members work/part.
